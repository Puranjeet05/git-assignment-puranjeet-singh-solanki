# GitHub & Git Assignment
## What I Learned from the Video
git add-To selectively prepare changes for a commit. This allows you to create highly focused, logical commits, even if you have multiple unrelated changes in your working directory.

git commit-To permanently save a logical unit of change in the repository's history, along with metadata like the author, timestamp, and a descriptive message.

Branching-To work on multiple features in parallel, keep experimental code separate from stable code, and facilitate team collaboration through mechanisms like pull requests.
